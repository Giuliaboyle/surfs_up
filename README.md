## Overview
### The objective of this project was to review weather patterns in Hawaii near a surf and ice cream shop. This analysis looked at weather patterns and temperature in the monts of June and December. By looking at the data we have organized, we are able to assess what kinds of weather the ice cream and surf shop would see at different points of the year. 
## Results
### The following images shows the June Weather stastics

### These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. The key takeaways:

1. Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
2. The minimum temperature of 56 in December and 64 in june  present greatest variance in the data sets. This data reflects a much lower temperature in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 in June and 3.74 in December we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.
3.  The maximum temperatures of 85 in Juneand 83 in December are also very similar.
 ### Summary
 Overall the weather in December and June is very similar. December ehibits has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.

Additional queries that could be run include: Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather, as well as a comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
