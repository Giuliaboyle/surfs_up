# surfs_up
## Overview
### The objective of this project was to review weather patterns in Hawaii near a surf and ice cream shop. This analysis looked at weather patterns and temperature in the monts of June and December. By looking at the data we have organized, we are able to assess what kinds of weather the ice cream and surf shop would see at different points of the year.
